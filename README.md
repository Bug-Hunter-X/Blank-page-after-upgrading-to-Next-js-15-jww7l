# Blank Page Issue in Next.js 15 App

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered after upgrading a Next.js 13 application to Next.js 15. The upgraded application renders a blank page without any apparent errors in the browser console.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`

Observe that the application renders a blank page.  The console should not show any JavaScript errors.

## Expected Behavior

The application should render a simple "Welcome to my Next.js app" heading, as it did in Next.js 13.

## Solution

This issue is likely caused by a conflict between the new Next.js 15 features and some outdated dependencies or configurations in the project. A detailed analysis might reveal more about the root cause, but following the steps in the provided `index.js` file often resolves it.
